# Employee_Database_SQL

# Project Overview

Hewlett Packard is preparing for a significant increase in the retirement of its workforce. To assist HP We have been tasked to create databases and a system to query the data, using SQL. The overall of the analysis seeks to answer two main questions about HP's workforce"
1.How many roles will need to be replaced once the employees of HP transition to retirement?
2.How many employees will be eligible to become mentors in the company's new mentorship program.

#Results

- 90,399 employees will become eligible for retirement in the next few years. 

- Most soon to be retirees (29,414) come from the Senior Engineer positions. 

- The company will be losing 57,668 Senior Position employees. Given the upcoming loss of employees with vast experience, the company will have to rely more on its mentorship program and other supporting programs to help replace this group. 


#Summary
Given the large number of soon-to-be retirees, HP will have to decide how to replace this transitioning workforce and make up for loss of work experience that was accumulated at more senior level positions. 

Creating a new database table containing the amount of eligible employees for the mentorship program, the data shows that only 1550 employees meet the current standards to become mentors for the mentorship program. 1550 is a small number compared to those leaving the company, hence HP will have to recruit more seaseoned individuals from outside its current workforce.

Some additional queries that I would make would be counting the new hires and comparing these numbers to retiring employess on an annual basis. This would be helpful to know when it would be needed to hire more versus less depending on upcoming retiring of the current workforce. I would also look at HR resources available and how changes to its programs affects the success/efficiency of each worker. It may be that by enhancing HR resources, HP can strenghten and maximize the productivity of its current workforce to make up for expected declines.
